Some work on the package while I was on sabbatical was funded by
Fondation Leducq through a grant to the LINAT collaboration and by the
Marsden Fund through a grant to the University of Auckland.

Patrick Aboyoun did the S-PLUS port of version 3.6-8

John Preston provided an example of the multistage rescaled bootstrap for testing.

The svyolr() code and the likelihood-based confidence intervals are largely ripped from
the MASS package of Venables & Ripley, and parts of the code for svycoxph() are modified 
from Therneau's survival package.
