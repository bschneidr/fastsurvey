\title{Specify survey design with replicate weights}
\description{
Some recent large-scale surveys specify replication weights rather than
the sampling design (partly for privacy reasons).  This function specifies the
data structure for such a survey.

   data = NULL, type = c("BRR", "Fay", "JK1","JKn","bootstrap",
   "ACS","successive-difference","JK2","other"),
   combined.weights=TRUE, rho = NULL, bootstrap.average=NULL,

\details{
  In the BRR method, the dataset is split into halves, and the
  difference between halves is used to estimate the variance. In Fay's
  method, rather than removing observations from half the sample they
  are given weight \code{rho} in one half-sample and \code{2-rho} in the
  other.  The ideal BRR analysis is restricted to a design where each
  stratum has two PSUs, however, it has been used in a much wider class
  of surveys. The \code{scale} and \code{rscales}
 arguments will be ignored (with a warning) if they are specified.
  
  The JK1 and JKn types are both jackknife estimators deleting one
  cluster at a time. JKn is designed for stratified and JK1 for
  unstratified designs.

 The successive-difference weights in the American Community Survey
 automatically use \code{scale = 4/ncol(repweights)} and \code{rscales=rep(1,
   ncol(repweights))}. This can be specified as \code{type="ACS"} or
 \code{type="successive-difference"}. The \code{scale} and \code{rscales}
 arguments will be ignored (with a warning) if they are specified.

 JK2 weights (\code{type="JK2"}), as in the California Health Interview
 Survey, automatically use \code{scale=1},  \code{rscales=rep(1, ncol(repweights))}.
 The \code{scale} and \code{rscales}
 arguments will be ignored (with a warning) if they are specified.

  Averaged bootstrap weights ("mean bootstrap") are used for some
  surveys from Statistics Canada. Yee et al (1999) describe their
  construction and use for one such survey.
  
  The variance is computed as the sum of squared deviations of the
  replicates from their mean.  This may be rescaled: \code{scale} is an
  overall multiplier and \code{rscales} is a vector of
  replicate-specific multipliers for the squared deviations. That is,
  \code{rscales} should have one entry for each column of \code{repweights}
  If thereplication weights incorporate the sampling weights
  (\code{combined.weights=TRUE}) or for \code{type="other"} these must
  be specified, otherwise they can be guessed from the weights.

  A finite population correction may be specified for \code{type="other"},
  \code{type="JK1"} and \code{type="JKn"}.  \code{fpc} must be a vector
  with one entry for each replicate. To specify sampling fractions use
  \code{fpctype="fraction"} and to specify the correction directly use
  \code{fpctype="correction"}

\code{repweights} may be a character string giving a regular expression
 for the replicate weight variables. For example, in the
California Health Interview Survey public-use data, the sampling weights are
\code{"rakedw0"} and the replicate weights are \code{"rakedw1"} to
\code{"rakedw80"}.  The regular expression \code{"rakedw[1-9]"}
matches the replicate weight variables (and not the sampling weight
variable).

\code{data} may be a character string giving the name of a table or view
in a relational database that can be accessed through the \code{DBI} 
interface. For DBI interfaces \code{dbtype} should be the name of the database
driver and \code{dbname} should be the name by which the driver identifies
the specific database (eg file name for SQLite).

The appropriate database interface package must already be loaded (eg
\code{RSQLite} for SQLite).  The survey design
object will contain the replicate weights, but actual variables will
be loaded from the database only as needed.  Use
\code{\link[=close.DBIsvydesign]{close}} to close the database connection and
\code{\link[=open.DBIsvydesign]{open}} to reopen the connection, eg, after
loading a saved object.

The database interface does not attempt to modify the underlying
database and so can be used with read-only permissions on the database.
 

  To generate your own replicate weights either use
  \code{\link{as.svrepdesign}} on a \code{survey.design} object, or see
  \code{\link{brrweights}}, \code{\link{bootweights}},
  \code{\link{jk1weights}} and \code{\link{jknweights}}
  
  The \code{model.frame} method extracts the observed data.
