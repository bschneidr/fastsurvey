\title{Student performance in California schools}
\description{
The Academic Performance Index is computed for all California schools
based on standardised testing of students. The data sets contain
information for all schools with at least 100 students and for various
probability samples of the data.
}
\usage{
data(api)
}
\format{
  The full population data in \code{apipop} are a data frame with 6194 observations on the following 37 variables.

    \item{emer}{percent teachers with emergency qualifications}
    \item{enroll}{number of students enrolled}

  The other data sets contain additional variables \code{pw} for
  sampling weights and \code{fpc} to compute finite population
  corrections to variance.

\details{
  \code{apipop} is the entire population, \code{apisrs} is a simple random sample,
 \code{apiclus1} is a cluster sample of school districts, \code{apistrat} is
  a sample stratified by \code{stype}, and \code{apiclus2} is a two-stage
  cluster sample of schools within districts.  The sampling weights in
 \code{apiclus1} are incorrect (the weight should be 757/15) but are as 
  obtained from UCLA.
