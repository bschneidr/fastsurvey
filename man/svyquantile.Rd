Quantiles under complex sampling.

\description{
Estimates quantiles and confidence intervals for them. This function was
completely re-written for version 4.1 of the survey package, and has a
wider range of ways to define the quantile. See the vignette for a list of them.

\details{
The \code{p}th quantile is defined as the value where the estimated cumulative
distribution function is equal to \code{p}. As with quantiles in
unweighted data, this definition only pins down the quantile to an
interval between two observations, and a rule is needed to interpolate.
The default is the mathematical definition, the lower end of the
quantile interval; \code{qrule="school"} uses the midpoint of the
quantile interval; \code{"hf1"} to {"hf9"} are weighted analogues of
\code{type=1} to \code{9} in \code{\link{quantile}}. See the vignette
"Quantile rules" for details and for how to write your own. 
  
By default, confidence intervals are estimated using Woodruff's (1952) method,
which involves computing the quantile, estimating a confidence interval
for the proportion of observations below the quantile, and then
transforming that interval using the estimated CDF.  In that context,
the \code{interval.type} argument specifies how the confidence interval
for the proportion is computed, matching \code{\link{svyciprop}}. In
contrast to \code{oldsvyquantile}, \code{NaN} is returned if a confidence
interval endpoint on the probability scale falls outside \code{[0,1]}.

There are two exceptions. For \code{svydesign} objects,
\code{interval.type="score"} asks for the Francisco & Fuller confidence
interval based on inverting a score test. According to Dorfmann &
Valliant, this interval has inferior performance to the \code{"beta"}
and \code{"logit"} intervals; it is provided for compatibility.

For replicate-weight designs, \code{interval.type="quantile"} ask for an
interval based directly on the replicates of the quantile. This interval
is not valid for jackknife-type replicates, though it should perform well for
bootstrap-type replicates, BRR, and SDR.

The \code{df} argument specifies degrees of freedom for a t-distribution
approximation to distributions of means. The default is the design degrees of
freedom. Specify \code{df=Inf} to use a Normal distribution (eg, for compatibility).

When the standard error is requested, it is estimated by dividing the
confidence interval length by the number of standard errors in a t
confidence interval with the specified \code{alpha}. For example, with
\code{alpha=0.05} and \code{df=Inf} the standard error is estimated as the confidence
interval length divided by \code{2*1.96}.
